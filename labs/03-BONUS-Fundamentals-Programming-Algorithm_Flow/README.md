# Algorithm Flows

The following exercise is split in various mini tasks. You are to define the algorithm flow for each of the tasks below. You can do that by either **writing down the steps**, or by **drawing a flow chart** for it (it can be done simply with **pen and paper**, or using some **online tool** like [Diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/)).

Here's an example:

- ### Example
Return the sum of two positive numbers

#### Writing down the Steps
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 3: If num1 < 0 OR num2 < 0
            Print error message
            Go to step 6
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to variable sum.
        sum = num1 + num2 
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop
```

With the above example in mind, define the flow of the following algorithms:

- ### Algorithm 1
Find the largest number among two numbers

- ### Algorithm 2
Find the largest number among three numbers

- ### Algorithm 3
Given a list of positive numbers, return the largest number on the list

- ### Algorithm 4
Determine wheter a given number is even or odd

- ### Algorithm 5
Calculate the sum of the first 50 numbers (from 1 to 50)
