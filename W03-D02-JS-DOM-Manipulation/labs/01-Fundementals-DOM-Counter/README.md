# Counter DOM Manipulation

1. Create a `index.js` and `index.html` file.

2. Link the `js` file to the `html` file.

3. Create a button in the `html` file with "+" for the content.

4. Create an `<h2>` tag with the content being `0`:
   ```html
   <h2>0</h2>
   ```
5.Create a function called `increaseCount()` that should increase the `<h2>` count by 1.

BONUS: Add a "-" button and create a function that will decrease the `<h2>` count by 1.

BONUS: Create a reset button that will reset the `<h2>` value to 0.
