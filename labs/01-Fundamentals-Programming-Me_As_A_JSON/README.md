# Me As a JSON

In this exercise, you'll have to transcribe **yourself** as a **JSON** file!

You'll have to create a JSON file from scratch. You can either use your prefered text editor, or just use an [Online JSON Editor like this one here](https://jsoneditoronline.org/).

> **Hint:** *If you don't feel comfortable putting your real data on the exercise, feel free to do it with fake data. The important thing here is the learning experience.*

## The YOU object
It should contain the following properties (with their respective types):

- `first_name: String` - Your first name
- `last_name: String` - Your last name
- `birth_date: Date` - Your birth date
- `age: Number` - your age
- `gender: String` - Your gender. For this exercise, assume you can provider either `M` for male, `F` for female or `O` for other.
- `nationality: String | String[]` - Your nationality, either as a string (single nationality) or an array of strings (double+ nationalities)
- `is_married: Boolean` - If you are married or not, as a boolean value 
- `has_children: Boolean` - If you have children or not, as a boolean value
- `hobbies: String[]` - Your hobbies, as an array of strings
- `address: Address` - Your address, as an address object (more on that below)
- `car: Car` - Your car, as a car object (more on that below. If you don't have one, it's fine to just put fake values - or your bicycle's data, why not!?)
- `favorite_tv_shows: String[]` - Your favorite TV shows, as an array of strings
- `pets: Pet[]` - Your pets, as an array of the pet object (more on that below. You should write at least two entries here - if you don't have at least two pets, then it's fine to put fake entry)


## Data Types
As you can see, each property (key) that describe you has it's own data (value) type. Let's check what each type represents:

### Basic Types
- `String`: A text. All you have to do is type a value between the quotes.

**Ex:**
```json
"My name"
```
- `Date`: For the sake of simplicity, we'll represent our date object as a formatted string. the format to be used is `dd.MM.yyyy`.

**Ex:**
```json
"09.07.2021"
```
- `Number`: Any number. No quotes needed. 
 
**Ex:**
```json
33
```
- `Boolean`: A boolean represents either **true** or **false**. No quotes needed. 

**Ex:**
```json
true
```
- `X[]`: An array of type **X**. An array represents a list of its specified type. 

**Ex of an array of strings**
```json 
["Hi!", "DCI", "Professional"]
```
- `Object`: Represents another object as a property. In our exercise, we use **custom models** to better define which kind of objects we're expecting as a value for each key that uses it. 

**Ex:**
```json
{
    "custom_object_property_1": "value1",
    "custom_object_property_2": "value2"
}
```

### Custom Types
We're also using custom types in our exercise. They are:

1. #### Address
The **Address object model** represents your address. 

It contains the following properties:

- `street: String` - Your street's name
- `house_number: String` - Your house's number
- `zip_code: Number` - Your ZIP code
- `district_name: String` - The name of your district (neighborhood)
- `city: String` - The city's name
- `country: String` - The country's name

1. #### Car
The **Car object model** represents your car. 

It contains the following properties:

- `model_name: String` - The car's model
- `brand_name: String` - The car's brand
- `year: Number` - The car's year, in a `yyyy` format

1. #### Pet
The **Pet object model** represents your pet. 

It contains the following properties:

- `name: String` - The pet's name
- `type: String` - The type of your pet. Correct values would be `Dog`, `Cat`, `Fish` etc.
- `breed: String` - Your pet's breed
- `age: Number` Your pet's age

## Navigating through the object
Once you have the object done, answer the following questions. Write down the full path to access each of the requested values. Consider that the reference to the object representing the **YOU** object is simply called `me`.


### assuming the object is stored in a variable called me:
1. #### How can you access your first name?
    - `me.first_name`
2. #### How can you access your last name?
    - `me.last_name`
3. #### How can you access your hobbies?
    - `me.hobbies`
    - `for (let i = 0; i < me.hobbies.length; i++) {
    console.log(me.hobbies[i]);
}`
4. #### How can you access your street's name?
    - `me.address.street`
5. #### How can you access your second pet's name?
    - `me.pets[1].name`
