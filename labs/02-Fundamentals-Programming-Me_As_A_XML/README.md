# Me As a XML

Similar to the last exercise, in this exercise you'll have to transcribe **yourself** as a **XML** file!

You'll have to create a XML file from scratch. You can either use your prefered text editor, or just use an [Online XML Editor like this one here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_xml_editor.htm).

> **Hint:** *If you don't feel comfortable putting your real data on the exercise, feel free to do it with fake data. The important thing here is the learning experience.*

## The YOU object
The **YOU** object can be represented with the `Me` tag. So, all in all, your solution should start like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Me>
...
</Me>
```

And in between the `Me` tag you can start populating with the following values about yourself:

- `FirstName` - Your first name
- `LastName` - Your last name
- `BirthDate` - Your birth date. Use the `dd.MM.yyyy` format.
- `Age` - Your age
- `Gender` - Your gender. For this exercise, assume you can provider either `M` for male, `F` for female or `O` for other.
- `Nationality` - Your nationality, either as a string (single nationality) or an array of strings (double+ nationalities). In the case of more than one nationality, wrap the `Nationality` entries inside a `Nationalities` entry.
- `IsMarried` - If you are married or not, as a boolean value 
- `HasChildren` - If you have children or not, as a boolean value
- `Hobbies: Hobby[]` - Your hobbies, as an array of `Hobby`
- `Address: Address` - Your address, as an address object (more on that below)
- `Car: Car` - Your car, as a car object (more on that below. If you don't have one, it's fine to just put fake values - or your bicycle's data, why not!?)
- `FavoriteTVShows: TVShow[]` - Your favorite TV shows, as an array of `TVShow`
- `Pets: Pet[]` - Your pets, as an array of the pet object (more on that below. You should write at least two entries here - if you don't have at least two pets, then it's fine to put fake entry)


## Data Types
Here, a few things change. In general, most values are just strings.

Special cases:

- `Nationality`: In the case of **double+ nationalities**, you can wrap the values with a `Nationalities` entry.

Ex:
```xml
<Nationalities>
    <Nationality>Nationality1</Nationality>
    <Nationality>Nationality2</Nationality>
</Nationalities>
```

- `Hobbies: Hobby[]`: Specify each hobby with the `Hobby` tag, and wrap them using the `Hobbies` tag.
- `FavoriteTVShows: TVShow[]`: Same here, but wrapping multiple `TVShow` inside `FavoriteTVShows`.

### Custom Types
The custom types here should use the **attributes** from the XML tags. An example of a tag using attributes is the following:

```xml
<MyTag myAttribute1="myValue1" myAttribute2="myValue2" />
```

1. #### Address
The **Address object model** represents your address. 

It contains the following attributes:

- `street` - Your street's name
- `houseNumber` - Your house's number
- `zipCode` - Your ZIP code
- `districtName` - The name of your district (neighborhood)
- `city` - The city's name
- `country` - The country's name

1. #### Car
The **Car object model** represents your car. 

It contains the following attributes:

- `modelName` - The car's model
- `brandName` - The car's brand
- `year` - The car's year, in a `yyyy` format

1. #### Pet
The **Pet object model** represents your pet. 

It contains the following attributes:

- `name` - The pet's name
- `type` - The type of your pet. Correct values would be `Dog`, `Cat`, `Fish` etc.
- `breed` - Your pet's breed
- `age` Your pet's age

Since we have an array of `Pet`, wrap them inside the `Pets` tag.
